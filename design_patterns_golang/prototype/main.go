-------------------- DEFINITION: Prototype Pattern

Prototype is a creational design pattern that allows cloning
objects, even complex ones, without coupling to their specific classes.

-------------------- APPLICATION

- Use the Prototype pattern when your code shouldnâ€™t depend 
on the concrete classes of objects that you need to copy.

-------------------- IMPLEMENTATION
- Create the prototype interface and declare the clone method in it. 
Or just add the method to all classes of an existing class hierarchy, 
if you have one.

- Every class must explicitly override the cloning method and use its own 
class name along with the new operator. Otherwise, the cloning method may 
produce an object of a parent class.
